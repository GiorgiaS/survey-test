st.markdown('The Metaverse is a dynamic virtual environment where people engage in various activities, such as meeting friends, playing games, and attending social events. This immersive world is typically accessed using a virtual reality headset, allowing users to connect from the comfort of their homes or any location. The Metaverse is rapidly evolving, offering endless possibilities for interaction, entertainment, and even work.')

st.markdown('We aim to create a system that respects everyone\'s privacy. This system will manage and balance the privacy preferences of all participants, including yours, along with the requirements of the shared space. In this survey, we will present two scenarios in the metaverse where you will set your privacy preferences. We will then integrate your choices with those of other users and the space\'s policies. Finally, we will ask you a few questions about how you feel about the new policy.')
st.markdown('### Scenario: Metaverse Working Space')
st.markdown('A metaverse working space (like Meetaverse) is a virtual 3D room where people can join to collaborate, organise meetings, and work together. The working room has some requirements to improve participants\' experiences, which are stated in the policies.')
st.markdown('We will assume that you are an employee of a software organisation called *SoftOr*, and you must access the working room. Then, we will show you two different contexts and ask you to select your privacy preferences related to the data the working room requires. For the survey, we consider the policy of a single data, namely, your body shape â€“ i.e., since you are accessing a working environment, you will be represented by an avatar that is close to your real physical aspect.')
